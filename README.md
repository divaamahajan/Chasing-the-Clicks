# Chasing-the-Clicks
Chasing the Clicks is a simple web application that counts the number of times a user clicks on a button and displays it on the screen.

## Getting Started
To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application requires no additional setup or installation.

## How to Use
Once the application is open, click on the "Click me!" button to increment the click count. The total number of clicks will be displayed on the screen.

The click count is stored in the user's local storage, which means it will persist even if the user closes the browser or navigates away from the page.

## Technologies Used
This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Google Analytics API to fetch data and display it on the page.
